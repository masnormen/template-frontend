# ðŸ”¥ React + Vite Frontend Template

This template can be used to kick-start a frontend project using React and TailwindCSS. It includes prettier, code linting, CSS framework, code output obfuscator, and even GitHub Actions flow that's ready to use and configure yourself.

It will work well especially if you use JetBrains Webstorm, because it takes care of `prettier` and `eslint` automatically. But with the right configuration, VSCode will work too.
